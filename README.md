Hello! Welcome to this beautiful project. I'm developing it using:
- Next.js
- React.js
- Zod
- Motion
- Lucide React icons
- Supabase

### To run the project
First, clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/enz0rd/lumaclone.git"
```
Then, once inside the project's folder, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install --force
```
After this, you need to set up your environment:
- Create a .env file on the root of the project
- Then, set the items below
```ini
DATABASE_URL="db connection url"

JWT_SECRET="*JWT Secret key*"
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="*smtp host*"
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=*smtp port*
EMAIL_SERVER_USER="*smtp email*"
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="*smtp email password*"
```
Finally, run the project using:
